"Musk was born to a Canadian mother and White South African father, and raised in Pretoria, South Africa. He briefly attended the University of Pretoria before moving to Canada at age 17. He matriculated at Queen's University and transferred to the University of Pennsylvania two years later, where he received a bachelor's degree in Economics and Physics. He moved to California in 1995 to attend Stanford University but decided instead to pursue a business career, co-founding the web software company Zip2 with his brother Kimbal. The startup was acquired by Compaq for $307 million in 1999. The same year, Musk co-founded online bank X.com, which merged with Confinity in 2000 to form PayPal. The company was bought by eBay in 2002 for $1.5 billion.",Musk was born to a Canadian mother and White South African father and raised in Pretoria South Africa He briefly attended the University of Pretoria before moving to Canada at age 17 He matriculated at Queens University and transferred to the University of Pennsylvania two years later where he received a bachelors degree in Economics and Physics He moved to California in 1995 to attend Stanford University but decided instead to pursue a business career cofounding the web software company Zip2 with his brother Kimbal The startup was acquired by Compaq for $307 million in 1999 The same year Musk cofounded online bank Xcom which merged with Confinity in 2000 to form PayPal The company was bought by eBay in 2002 for $15 billion,Musk was born to a Canadian mother and White South African father and raised in Pretoria South Africa He briefly attended the University of Pretoria before moving to Canada at age 17 He matriculated at Queens University and transferred to the University of Pennsylvania two years later where he received a bachelors degree in Economics and Physics He moved to California in 1995 to attend Stanford University but decided instead to pursue a business career cofounding the web software company Zip2 with his brother Kimbal The startup was acquired by Compaq for $307 million in 1999 The same year Musk cofounded online bank Xcom which merged with Confinity in 2000 to form PayPal The company was bought by eBay in 2002 for $15 billion,musk born canadian mother white south african father raised pretoria south africa briefly attended university pretoria moving canada age matriculated queens university transferred university pennsylvania two years later received bachelors degree economics physics moved california attend stanford university decided instead pursue business career cofounding web software company brother kimbal startup acquired compaq million year musk cofounded online bank xcom merged confinity form paypal company bought ebay billion,musk was born to a canadian mother and white south african father and raised in pretoria south africa he briefly attended the university of pretoria before moving to canada at age 17 he matriculated at queens university and transferred to the university of pennsylvania two years later where he received a bachelors degree in economics and physics he moved to california in 1995 to attend stanford university but decided instead to pursue a business career cofounding the web software company zip2 with his brother kimbal the startup was acquired by compaq for $307 million in 1999 the same year musk cofounded online bank xcom which merged with confinity in 2000 to form paypal the company was bought by ebay in 2002 for $15 billion,"['musk', 'was', 'born', 'to', 'a', 'canadian', 'mother', 'and', 'white', 'south', 'african', 'father', 'and', 'raised', 'in', 'pretoria', 'south', 'africa', 'he', 'briefly', 'attended', 'the', 'university', 'of', 'pretoria', 'before', 'moving', 'to', 'canada', 'at', 'age', '17', 'he', 'matriculated', 'at', 'queens', 'university', 'and', 'transferred', 'to', 'the', 'university', 'of', 'pennsylvania', 'two', 'years', 'later', 'where', 'he', 'received', 'a', 'bachelors', 'degree', 'in', 'economics', 'and', 'physics', 'he', 'moved', 'to', 'california', 'in', '1995', 'to', 'attend', 'stanford', 'university', 'but', 'decided', 'instead', 'to', 'pursue', 'a', 'business', 'career', 'cofounding', 'the', 'web', 'software', 'company', 'zip2', 'with', 'his', 'brother', 'kimbal', 'the', 'startup', 'was', 'acquired', 'by', 'compaq', 'for', '$', '307', 'million', 'in', '1999', 'the', 'same', 'year', 'musk', 'cofounded', 'online', 'bank', 'xcom', 'which', 'merged', 'with', 'confinity', 'in', '2000', 'to', 'form', 'paypal', 'the', 'company', 'was', 'bought', 'by', 'ebay', 'in', '2002', 'for', '$', '15', 'billion']","['musk', 'was', 'born', 'to', 'a', 'canadian', 'mother', 'and', 'white', 'south', 'african', 'father', 'and', 'rais', 'in', 'pretoria', 'south', 'africa', 'he', 'briefli', 'attend', 'the', 'univers', 'of', 'pretoria', 'befor', 'move', 'to', 'canada', 'at', 'age', '17', 'he', 'matricul', 'at', 'queen', 'univers', 'and', 'transfer', 'to', 'the', 'univers', 'of', 'pennsylvania', 'two', 'year', 'later', 'where', 'he', 'receiv', 'a', 'bachelor', 'degre', 'in', 'econom', 'and', 'physic', 'he', 'move', 'to', 'california', 'in', '1995', 'to', 'attend', 'stanford', 'univers', 'but', 'decid', 'instead', 'to', 'pursu', 'a', 'busi', 'career', 'cofound', 'the', 'web', 'softwar', 'compani', 'zip2', 'with', 'his', 'brother', 'kimbal', 'the', 'startup', 'was', 'acquir', 'by', 'compaq', 'for', '$', '307', 'million', 'in', '1999', 'the', 'same', 'year', 'musk', 'cofound', 'onlin', 'bank', 'xcom', 'which', 'merg', 'with', 'confin', 'in', '2000', 'to', 'form', 'paypal', 'the', 'compani', 'was', 'bought', 'by', 'ebay', 'in', '2002', 'for', '$', '15', 'billion']"
